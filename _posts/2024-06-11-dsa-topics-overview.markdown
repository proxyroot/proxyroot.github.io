## üß± Data Structures and Use Cases

1. [Array / List](https://proxyroot.com/arrays-overview/) ‚Äî Store ordered data like a leaderboard or playlist; simple and fast for indexed access.
2. [HashMap / Dictionary](https://proxyroot.com/hashmap-overview/) ‚Äî Count word frequencies, cache results, or look up values in constant time.
3. [Set](https://proxyroot.com/set-overview/) ‚Äî Remove duplicates and check membership efficiently.
4. [Stack](https://proxyroot.com/stack-overview/) ‚Äî Manage undo operations, parse expressions, or track browser history (LIFO order).
5. [Queue / Deque](https://proxyroot.com/queue-deque-overview/) ‚Äî Schedule jobs, perform BFS, or build an LRU cache.
6. [Heap / Priority Queue](https://proxyroot.com/heap-priority-queue/) ‚Äî Schedule tasks, solve top-K problems, or implement Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.
7. [Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix)](https://proxyroot.com/graph-overview/) ‚Äî Model social networks, routes, or dependencies between tasks.
8. [Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://proxyroot.com/trie-overview/) ‚Äî Power auto-complete, spell checking, or IP routing.
9. [Linked List (Singly/Doubly)](https://proxyroot.com/linked-list-overview/) ‚Äî Cycle through playlists, manage browser tabs, or build stacks/queues.
10. [Union-Find / Disjoint Set](https://proxyroot.com/union-find-overview/) ‚Äî Detect cycles, manage network connectivity, or build Kruskal‚Äôs MST.
11. [Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree](https://proxyroot.com/segment-fenwick-tree/) ‚Äî Answer range queries (sum, min, max) efficiently in time-series data.
12. [Binary Search Tree / AVL / Red-Black Tree](https://proxyroot.com/bst-overview/) ‚Äî Support fast in-order traversal and range searching.

## üîÅ Algorithms and Use Cases

1. [Binary Search](https://proxyroot.com/binary-search/) ‚Äî Quickly find elements in sorted arrays or optimize search space.
2. [DFS / BFS](https://proxyroot.com/dfs-bfs/) ‚Äî Explore mazes, find paths, or identify connected components in graphs.
3. [Dijkstra‚Äôs / A*](https://proxyroot.com/dijkstra-shortest-paths/) ‚Äî Find the shortest path in weighted graphs (like Google Maps).
4. [Kruskal‚Äôs / Prim‚Äôs](https://proxyroot.com/mst/) ‚Äî Build minimum spanning trees for network design.
5. [Dynamic Programming](https://proxyroot.com/memoization-overview/) ‚Äî Solve problems like Fibonacci, knapsack, or edit distance by breaking them into subproblems.
6. [Backtracking](https://proxyroot.com/backtracking/) ‚Äî Tackle puzzles like Sudoku, permutations, or the N-Queens problem.
7. [Sliding Window](https://proxyroot.com/kadane-algorithm/) ‚Äî Find max sum subarrays or longest substrings without repeats efficiently.
8. [Two Pointer](https://proxyroot.com/two-pointer/) ‚Äî Solve pair sum or in-place duplicate removal in sorted arrays.
9. [Topological Sort](https://proxyroot.com/topological-sort/) ‚Äî Schedule tasks or resolve course prerequisites in order.
10. [Greedy](https://proxyroot.com/greedy/) ‚Äî Make locally optimal choices for problems like activity selection or coin change.

## üöÄ How to Prepare for DSA Mastery

- **Start with the basics:** Understand arrays, lists, and hashmaps before moving to advanced structures.
- **Practice coding:** Implement each data structure and algorithm from scratch to build intuition.
- **Solve real problems:** Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces to apply what you learn.
- **Review annotated code:** Check out the code examples in each post for clear explanations and comments.
- **Build projects:** Apply DSA concepts in small projects (e.g., a to-do app, a simple cache, or a pathfinder).
- **Stay consistent:** Practice a little every day, and revisit tricky topics regularly.
