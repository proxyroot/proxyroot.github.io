## 🧱 Data Structures and Use Cases

1. [Array / List](/arrays-overview/) — Store ordered data like a leaderboard or playlist; simple and fast for indexed access.
2. [HashMap / Dictionary](/hashmap-overview/) — Count word frequencies, cache results, or look up values in constant time.
3. [Set](/set-overview/) — Remove duplicates and check membership efficiently.
4. [Stack](/stack-overview/) — Manage undo operations, parse expressions, or track browser history (LIFO order).
5. [Queue / Deque](/queue-deque-overview/) — Schedule jobs, perform BFS, or build an LRU cache.
6. [Heap / Priority Queue](/heap-priority-queue/) — Schedule tasks, solve top-K problems, or implement Dijkstra’s algorithm.
7. [Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix)](/graph-overview/) — Model social networks, routes, or dependencies between tasks.
8. [Trie (Prefix Tree)](/trie-overview/) — Power auto-complete, spell checking, or IP routing.
9. [Linked List (Singly/Doubly)](/linked-list-overview/) — Cycle through playlists, manage browser tabs, or build stacks/queues.
10. [Union-Find / Disjoint Set](/union-find-overview/) — Detect cycles, manage network connectivity, or build Kruskal’s MST.
11. [Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree](https://proxyroot.com/segment-tree-fenwick/) — Answer range queries (sum, min, max) efficiently in time-series data.
12. [Binary Search Tree / AVL / Red-Black Tree](/bst-overview/) — Support fast in-order traversal and range searching.

## 🔁 Algorithms and Use Cases

1. Binary Search — Quickly find elements in sorted arrays or optimize search space.
2. [DFS / BFS](/graph-algorithms/) — Explore mazes, find paths, or identify connected components in graphs.
3. [Dijkstra’s / A*](/dijkstra-shortest-paths/) — Find the shortest path in weighted graphs (like Google Maps).
4. Kruskal’s / Prim’s — Build minimum spanning trees for network design.
5. [Dynamic Programming](/memoization-overview/) — Solve problems like Fibonacci, knapsack, or edit distance by breaking them into subproblems.
6. [Backtracking](/backtracking-recursion-tree/) — Tackle puzzles like Sudoku, permutations, or the N-Queens problem.
7. [Sliding Window](/sliding-window/) — Find max sum subarrays or longest substrings without repeats efficiently.
8. [Two Pointer](/two-pointers/) — Solve pair sum or in-place duplicate removal in sorted arrays.
9. [Topological Sort](/topological-sort/) — Schedule tasks or resolve course prerequisites in order.
10. [Greedy](/greedy-algorithms/) — Make locally optimal choices for problems like activity selection or coin change.
11. [Divide & Conquer](/divide-and-conquer/) — Break problems into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine their solutions (used in merge sort, quick sort, etc.).

## 🚀 How to Prepare for DSA Mastery

- **Start with the basics:** Understand arrays, lists, and hashmaps before moving to advanced structures.
- **Practice coding:** Implement each data structure and algorithm from scratch to build intuition.
- **Solve real problems:** Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces to apply what you learn.
- **Review annotated code:** Check out the code examples in each post for clear explanations and comments.
- **Build projects:** Apply DSA concepts in small projects (e.g., a to-do app, a simple cache, or a pathfinder).
- **Stay consistent:** Practice a little every day, and revisit tricky topics regularly.
