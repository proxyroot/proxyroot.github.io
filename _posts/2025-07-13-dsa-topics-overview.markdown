## 🧱 Data Structures and Use Cases

1. [Array / List](/2023-01-01-arrays-overview) — Store ordered data like a leaderboard or playlist; simple and fast for indexed access.
2. [HashMap / Dictionary](/2023-01-02-hashmap-overview) — Count word frequencies, cache results, or look up values in constant time.
3. [Set](/2023-01-03-set-overview) — Remove duplicates and check membership efficiently.
4. [Stack](/2023-01-04-stack-overview) — Manage undo operations, parse expressions, or track browser history (LIFO order).
5. [Queue / Deque](/2023-01-05-queue-deque-overview) — Schedule jobs, perform BFS, or build an LRU cache.
6. [Heap / Priority Queue](/2023-01-06-heap-priority-queue) — Schedule tasks, solve top-K problems, or implement Dijkstra’s algorithm.
7. [Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix)](/2023-01-07-graph-overview) — Model social networks, routes, or dependencies between tasks.
8. [Trie (Prefix Tree)](/2023-01-08-trie-overview) — Power auto-complete, spell checking, or IP routing.
9. [Linked List (Singly/Doubly)](/2023-01-09-linked-list-overview) — Cycle through playlists, manage browser tabs, or build stacks/queues.
10. [Union-Find / Disjoint Set](/2023-01-10-union-find-overview) — Detect cycles, manage network connectivity, or build Kruskal’s MST.
11. [Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree](/2023-01-11-segment-fenwick-tree) — Answer range queries (sum, min, max) efficiently in time-series data.
12. [Binary Search Tree / AVL / Red-Black Tree](/2023-01-12-bst-overview) — Support fast in-order traversal and range searching.

## 🔁 Algorithms and Use Cases

1. [Binary Search](/2023-02-01-binary-search) — Quickly find elements in sorted arrays or optimize search space.
2. [DFS / BFS](/2023-02-02-dfs-bfs) — Explore mazes, find paths, or identify connected components in graphs.
3. [Dijkstra’s / A*](/2023-07-03-dijkstra-shortest-paths) — Find the shortest path in weighted graphs (like Google Maps).
4. [Kruskal’s / Prim’s](/2023-02-04-mst) — Build minimum spanning trees for network design.
5. [Dynamic Programming](/2023-07-01-memoization-overview) — Solve problems like Fibonacci, knapsack, or edit distance by breaking them into subproblems.
6. [Backtracking](/2025-01-10-backtracking) — Tackle puzzles like Sudoku, permutations, or the N-Queens problem.
7. [Sliding Window](/2023-03-19-kadane-algorithm) — Find max sum subarrays or longest substrings without repeats efficiently.
8. [Two Pointer](/2023-02-08-two-pointer) — Solve pair sum or in-place duplicate removal in sorted arrays.
9. [Topological Sort](/2023-02-09-topological-sort) — Schedule tasks or resolve course prerequisites in order.
10. [Greedy](/2023-02-10-greedy) — Make locally optimal choices for problems like activity selection or coin change.

## 🚀 How to Prepare for DSA Mastery

- **Start with the basics:** Understand arrays, lists, and hashmaps before moving to advanced structures.
- **Practice coding:** Implement each data structure and algorithm from scratch to build intuition.
- **Solve real problems:** Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces to apply what you learn.
- **Review annotated code:** Check out the code examples in each post for clear explanations and comments.
- **Build projects:** Apply DSA concepts in small projects (e.g., a to-do app, a simple cache, or a pathfinder).
- **Stay consistent:** Practice a little every day, and revisit tricky topics regularly.
