## 🧱 Data Structures and Use Cases

1. **[Array / List](/arrays-overview/)** — Store ordered data like a leaderboard or playlist; simple and fast for indexed access.

   - **Operations:** O(1) access, O(n) search

2. **[HashMap / Dictionary](/hashmap-overview/)** — Count word frequencies, cache results, or look up values in constant time.
   - **Example:** `{"apple": 3, "banana": 2}` - word count
   - **Operations:** O(1) average for all operations

3. **[Set](/set-overview/)** — Remove duplicates and check membership efficiently.
   - **Example:** `{1, 2, 3, 4}` - unique user IDs
   - **Operations:** O(1) membership testing

4. **[Stack](/stack-overview/)** — Manage undo operations, parse expressions, or track browser history (LIFO order).
   - **Example:** `[page1, page2, page3]` - browser history
   - **Operations:** O(1) push/pop

5. **[Queue / Deque](/queue-deque-overview/)** — Schedule jobs, perform BFS, or build an LRU cache.
   - **Example:** `[task1, task2, task3]` - job queue
   - **Operations:** O(1) enqueue/dequeue

6. **[Heap / Priority Queue](/heap-priority-queue/)** — Schedule tasks, solve top-K problems, or implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
   - **Example:** `[10, 8, 5, 3, 1]` - priority queue
   - **Operations:** O(log n) insert/delete, O(1) peek

7. **[Graph (Adjacency List/Matrix)](/graph-overview/)** — Model social networks, routes, or dependencies between tasks.
   - **Example:** `{A: [B, C], B: [A, D], C: [A, E]}`
   - **Operations:** O(V + E) traversal

8. **[Trie (Prefix Tree)](/trie-overview/)** — Power auto-complete, spell checking, or IP routing.
   - **Example:** `root → c → a → t*` (stores "cat")
   - **Operations:** O(L) where L is word length

9. **[Linked List (Singly/Doubly)](/linked-list-overview/)** — Cycle through playlists, manage browser tabs, or build stacks/queues.
   - **Example:** `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → null`
   - **Operations:** O(1) insert/delete, O(n) search

10. **[Union-Find / Disjoint Set](/union-find-overview/)** — Detect cycles, manage network connectivity, or build Kruskal's MST.
    - **Example:** `parent: [1, 1, 3, 1, 4]` - connected components
    - **Operations:** O(α(n)) nearly constant time

11. **[Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree](https://proxyroot.com/segment-tree-fenwick/)** — Answer range queries (sum, min, max) efficiently in time-series data.
    - **Example:** Range sum queries on `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`
    - **Operations:** O(log n) query and update

12. **[Binary Search Tree / AVL / Red-Black Tree](/bst-overview/)** — Support fast in-order traversal and range searching.
    - **Example:** `5 → 3 → 7` (balanced tree)
    - **Operations:** O(log n) average, O(n) worst case

## 🔁 Algorithms and Use Cases

1. **Binary Search** — Quickly find elements in sorted arrays or optimize search space.
   - **Example:** Find 7 in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` in O(log n)
   - **Complexity:** O(log n)

2. **[DFS / BFS](/graph-algorithms/)** — Explore mazes, find paths, or identify connected components in graphs.
   - **Example:** DFS: A → B → D → E, BFS: A → B → C → D → E
   - **Complexity:** O(V + E)

3. **[Dijkstra's / A*](/dijkstra-shortest-paths/)** — Find the shortest path in weighted graphs (like Google Maps).
   - **Example:** Shortest path from A to E with weights
   - **Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with binary heap

4. **Kruskal's / Prim's** — Build minimum spanning trees for network design.
   - **Example:** Connect all cities with minimum cable cost
   - **Complexity:** O(E log E) for Kruskal's

5. **[Dynamic Programming](/memoization-overview/)** — Solve problems like Fibonacci, knapsack, or edit distance by breaking them into subproblems.
   - **Example:** `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` for Fibonacci
   - **Complexity:** Varies by problem

6. **[Backtracking](/backtracking-recursion-tree/)** — Tackle puzzles like Sudoku, permutations, or the N-Queens problem.
   - **Example:** Generate all permutations of [1, 2, 3]
   - **Complexity:** Often exponential

7. **[Sliding Window](/sliding-window/)** — Find max sum subarrays or longest substrings without repeats efficiently.
   - **Example:** Longest substring without repeating characters
   - **Complexity:** O(n)

8. **[Two Pointer](/two-pointers/)** — Solve pair sum or in-place duplicate removal in sorted arrays.
   - **Example:** Find pair that sums to target in sorted array
   - **Complexity:** O(n)

9. **[Topological Sort](/topological-sort/)** — Schedule tasks or resolve course prerequisites in order.
   - **Example:** Course schedule: A → B → C → D
   - **Complexity:** O(V + E)

10. **[Greedy](/greedy-algorithms/)** — Make locally optimal choices for problems like activity selection or coin change.
    - **Example:** Select maximum non-overlapping intervals
    - **Complexity:** Often O(n log n) due to sorting

11. **[Divide & Conquer](/divide-and-conquer/)** — Break problems into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine their solutions (used in merge sort, quick sort, etc.).
    - **Example:** Merge sort: divide → conquer → combine
    - **Complexity:** Often O(n log n)
