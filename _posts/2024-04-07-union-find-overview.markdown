Union-Find (Disjoint Set) is a data structure for efficiently managing and merging disjoint sets, supporting fast union and find operations. This post covers the principles of union-find, its applications, and provides practical Python examples and problems.

## Overview

A **disjoint set** (or **Union-Find**) is a data structure to keep track of a partition of elements into disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.

Supports two main operations efficiently:

- `find(x)`: returns the root/representative of the set that contains `x`
- `union(x, y)`: merges the sets containing `x` and `y`

With **path compression** and **union by rank**, both operations run in nearly constant time: `O(Œ±(n))`.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use (Python)

```python
# Implementation of Union-Find (Disjoint Set) with path compression and union by rank
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))  # Each node is its own parent initially
        self.rank = [0] * size           # Used to keep tree flat

    def find(self, x):
        # Find the root of x with path compression
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        # Union by rank: attach smaller tree to larger
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX == rootY:
            return False  # Already in the same set
        if self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += 1
        return True
# All operations above are nearly O(1) due to path compression and union by rank
```

## üì¶ Use Cases

- Detecting cycles in undirected graphs
- Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm (minimum spanning tree)
- Connected components in networks
- Dynamic connectivity problems

## üìò Sample Problem 1: Number of Connected Components

> Given `n` nodes and a list of undirected edges, return the number of connected components.

```python
def count_components(n, edges):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    for u, v in edges:
        uf.union(u, v)
    return len(set(uf.find(i) for i in range(n)))
```

## üìò Sample Problem 2: Accounts Merge

> Merge email accounts that belong to the same user (based on overlapping emails).

## üîÅ Variants

- Union by size
- Lazy union (less eager compression)
- Persistent union-find (with rollback support)
